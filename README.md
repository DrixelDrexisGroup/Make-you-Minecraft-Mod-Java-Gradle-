How can I make a Minecraft Mod?
First, open the URL (https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/idea/download/?section=windows) in your browser and select the version that matches your operating system. Select Community Edition Download at the bottom.
Then install, Windows opens directly, and Linux runs the idea or idea.sh under bin. Download the plugin, find the one with the Minecraft checkered icon, install and restart IDEA, and create a new project
If compiling, please install Gradle for Windows users and apt install gradle for Linux users. Then the project directory gradle build
Thanks!
